# Coding Challenges
Here you will find different questions and solutions that I have found to solve them.  My focus in creating solutions to these problems is to better understand time complexity, space complexity and recursive algorithms.

## Reverse Word Order In Place
This is challenge I found on a Youtube Channel that focuses on technical coding interviews. As I have come to encounter more problems similar to this, a recursive approach seems to be most natural.  Here we first reverse the order of the list character by character.  This reverses the order the words, but the words are now spelled backwards.  To flip the words, we go through the list and reverse the current section anytime we encounter a space or the end of the list.

## NumberBaseConverter.py
This program will take an input convert the number to a different base system and output the result.  Acceptable conversions are any number between base-1 and base-16 (hexadecimal)
